## Description 

Welcome to our library management system project! We are excited to introduce our user-friendly GUI interface that simplifies the process of managing library resources. Our project is designed with Python's tkinter.ttk module as the front end and SQLite as the back end, providing a powerful and efficient tool for librarians and library users alike. Each section of our GUI allows users to execute SQL queries by simply giving input and pressing a button!
